# About Mode3 Build

BootNTR-Mode3 is a special build of BootNTR for running NTR with extended memory games on Old3DS.

**It is no use to install BootNTR-Mode3 on New3DS** since the original one works just fine.

See https://github.com/44670/BootNTR/wiki/Extended-memory-games-on-O3DS for how to launch extended memory games with NTR.
